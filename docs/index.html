  <h1>TIAGo *gesture memory* scenario</h1>
  <p>This page host extra material about the implementation of a gesture-based memory game with a TIAGo robot (PAL Robotics).</p>
  <p>The application has been developed at the WE-COBOT (Wearable and Collaborative Robotics) lab of the Polo Territoriale di Lecco - Politecnico di Milano.</p>
  <p>The aim of the game is to engage older adults in a robot-mediated game to stimulate working memory and mild physical activity, thus contributing to prevent physical and cognitive decline.</p>
